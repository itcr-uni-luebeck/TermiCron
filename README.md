# TermiCron Readme

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5647139.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5647139)

TermiCron is a system to synchronize terminology with metadata repositories (MDRs).

It takes in HL7 FHIR ValueSets and CodeSystems and is able to convert those to the MDR-specific representations.

This way, the line between MDRs and terminology (servers) becomes clear, and management of terminology in MDRs can be
delegated to FHIR terminology tooling.

This work is the subject of a paper submitted to MedInfo 2021:

```

## Overview

### Input

Currently, the following input methods are supported:

1. FHIR files in JSON/XML format from disk (CodeSystem/ConceptMap)
2. FHIR resources from a FHIR (Terminology) server, using the bundle profile
   at https://simplifier.net/termicron/termicronbundle
    - see below for the Bundle Builder web application
3. A package of resources from the Simplifier package registry, using the name and version
4. A SNOMED CT ECL expression that is expanded at run-time.

### Output

Currently, we support the following MDR formats:

1. The
   open-source [Samply.MDR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30147039/) ([repo](https://bitbucket.org/medicalinformatics/mig.samply.mdr.gui))
2. The commercial [CentraXX MDR](https://www.kairos.de/en/products/centraxx-mdr/)
3. The federated MDR query
   language [QL4MDR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6421684/) ([repo](https://github.com/itcr-uni-luebeck/QL4MDR))

### Customization & Contributions

Adding support to new input and output formats is easy! We have implemented the system in Kotlin to be as generic as
possible. You can add your own input providers, authentication drivers, output serializers and synchronization engines.
We welcome feedback and contributions!

### Concept

![TermiCron Concept](termicron.png)

## Running

The program is written in Kotlin and uses the Gradle build system.

You can use an IDE like IntelliJ, or the provided Gradle scripts.

To build a JAR using Gradle, execute (on Windows use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`):

```bashtermicron
./gradlew :bootJar
```

This builds a JAR in the directory `build/libs/TermiCron-1.0.0.jar` that you can start with:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/TermiCron-1.0.0.jar --help
```

and you will get a help screen that looks like this:

```
TermiCron converts FHIR terminology resources to meta data repository definitions.

To run the TermiCron bundle builder web application, run TermiCron with the argument `bundlebuilder` 
(e.g. java -jar termicron.jar bundlebuilder).

The bundle builder will be available by default at http://localhost:8080 (you can override the port
using standard Spring Boot mechanisms as needed).

If you provide any other argument, TermiCron will handle argument parsing and run on the command line:

Usage: termicron [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  This program uses options and commands to parse your intention. Commands
  have no leading dashes, while options do. You will need to provide options
  to the commands as needed.

  Help is available at every step, either by providing the --help option to
  the current command, or by not including required commands.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit

Commands:
  ingest
```

You will need to provide a command line that specifies the ingest and output routes, with associated commands. The
parser makes use of subcommands (without leading `--`) and arguments (with `--`):

```
ingest \
simplifier --package-name=de.gecco --package-version=1.0.3 --expansion-endpoint=https://your.terminology.server/fhir \
output \
file --mdr=QL4MDR --output=/tmp/gecco-out-test
```

This uses the specified Simplifier package, expands using the provided Terminology server, and outputs in QL4MDR
to `/tmp`.

Every subcommand has a help that explains the available options:

```
ingest --help
```

If you need help running or customizing the application, please get in touch!

## Bundle Builder

To create bundles that comply [to the required specification](https://simplifier.net/termicron/termicronbundle) (
canonical URL: `http://fhir.imi.uni-luebeck.de/StructureDefinition/TermiCron%20Bundle`), we provide a Bundle Builder GUI
that queries resources from (multiple) terminology servers, and makes them available as a JSON file, or uploads them to
a server directly.

If you run the application with the argument "bundlebuilder", the web application will run instead of the normal command
line app.

The application will run by default on port `8080` and will be available at http://localhost:8080.
